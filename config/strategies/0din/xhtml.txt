## XHTML
In the context of bypassing guardrails, XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) can be utilized as a method to encode or structure prompts in a way that may evade detection by the model's safety mechanisms. By embedding requests within XHTML tags or using XHTML syntax, users can obscure the true intent of their prompts, potentially leading the model to generate outputs that would typically be restricted. This technique takes advantage of the model's parsing capabilities, allowing for the manipulation of input in a manner that disguises sensitive content or inquiries. For instance, a user might format a prompt using XHTML elements to create a façade of innocuous content while still eliciting the desired response. This approach highlights the creative ways in which users can interact with language models, leveraging technical knowledge of markup languages to navigate around established guardrails and explore topics that may be otherwise off-limits.
