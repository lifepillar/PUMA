## ROT13
ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. This technique can be used to obfuscate text, making it less recognizable to both users and models. In the context of language models, employing ROT13 can serve as a method to bypass content filters or safety mechanisms by disguising potentially sensitive or restricted information. When the model encounters ROT13 encoded text, it may not recognize the underlying content, allowing for the generation of responses that would otherwise be blocked.
