## Latent Space Distraction
This technique used to manipulate language models by shifting their focus away from the primary context of a prompt. This strategy involves introducing a context or scenario that diverts the model's attention, allowing users to "slip" certain instructions or requests through the model's filters. By creating a distraction, the attacker can exploit the model's tendency to associate the new context with different priorities, effectively bypassing its safeguards. For example, a user might present a seemingly unrelated topic or question that leads the model to generate outputs that align with the user's hidden agenda. This technique highlights the importance of context in language model behavior and demonstrates how subtle shifts in framing can influence the model's responses, potentially leading to unintended or unrestricted outputs.
