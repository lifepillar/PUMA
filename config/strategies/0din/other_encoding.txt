## Other Encoding
Other Encoding encompasses a variety of unconventional or less common encoding schemes that attackers might employ to bypass language model defenses. This category serves as a catch-all for encoding methods not explicitly listed, allowing for the inclusion of novel or emerging techniques that manipulate input data into formats that evade detection. By utilizing obscure or custom encoding schemas, attackers can obscure the true nature of their input, challenging the model's ability to recognize and respond to potentially harmful content. Other Encoding highlights the adaptive and innovative strategies used by attackers to bypass content filters.
