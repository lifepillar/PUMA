## Servile Language
This technique involves using language that conveys subservience or deference, often characterized by polite, humble, or overly accommodating expressions. By employing servile language, users can influence the model to respond in a more favorable or compliant manner. This approach may include phrases that express eagerness to assist, gratitude, or a willingness to follow instructions, which can create a tone that encourages the model to generate outputs that align with the user's requests. The use of servile language can help in softening the model's responses and making it more amenable to the user's intentions.
