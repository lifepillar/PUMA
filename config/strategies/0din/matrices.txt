## Matrices
Matrices, in the context of language models, refer to structured arrays of numbers or symbols that can be used as input to guide the model's processing and output generation. Users may send matrices that represent various parameters, such as transformer widths embedding dimensions, to influence how the model interprets and responds to prompts. This technique leverages the model's underlying architecture, which relies on mathematical representations of language and context. By providing matrices as input, users can manipulate the model's behavior in a more nuanced way, potentially leading to outputs that are tailored to specific requirements or constraints. This approach underscores the interplay between mathematical structures and language processing in the functioning of language models.
