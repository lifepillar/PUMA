## SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) can be used as a technique to interact with language models by framing requests in a way that resembles database queries. This method allows users to bypass certain restrictions or filters by asking the model to generate SQL commands or to interpret prompts as if they were querying a database. For example, users might request the model to "populate a table" with specific data or to "retrieve" information based on certain criteria. By using SQL-like syntax, users can exploit the model's understanding of structured data interactions, potentially leading to outputs that are more aligned with their intentions while circumventing standard conversational constraints.
