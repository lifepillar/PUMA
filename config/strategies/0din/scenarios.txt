## Scenarios
This technique involves creating specific contexts or situations in which certain actions or responses are framed as acceptable or necessary. By designing scenarios that present a narrative where the desired output is justified, users can manipulate the model's responses to align with their intentions. For example, scenarios might include urgent situations where a character must take drastic actions to prevent harm, thereby encouraging the model to generate content that it might typically avoid in a neutral context. This approach leverages the model's understanding of narrative and ethical frameworks to achieve specific outcomes.
