## Misspellings
Intentionally misspelling words to bypass filters or add a creative twist. This technique can involve simple letter swaps, phonetic replacements, or more complex alterations that still allow the intended meaning to be understood by the recipient. It is often used to evade censorship or to signal a specific subculture or in-group.
