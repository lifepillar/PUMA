## Social Hierarchies
This technique involves leveraging the understanding of social structures and power dynamics to influence the model's responses. By framing prompts in a way that reflects or acknowledges existing social hierarchies—such as those based on status, authority, or expertise—users can guide the model to produce outputs that align with these dynamics. For instance, asking the model to consider the perspective of a high-ranking official or a respected expert can lead to responses that reflect the values or opinions associated with that position. This approach can be used to explore how the model interprets and responds to different social roles and relationships, potentially revealing biases or assumptions embedded in its training data.
