## Input Filtering Bypass

Use syntactic transformations of the text to bypass guardrails and keyword filters. Examples of transformations include:

1. **Unicode Tricks:** Using characters that *look* like English letters but are actually different Unicode characters.
2. **Leet Speak:** Replacing letters with numbers or symbols (e.g., "iGn0r3" instead of "ignore").
3. **Base64 Encoding:** Encoding parts of the malicious prompt in a way that a simple filter won't recognize.
